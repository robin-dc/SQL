SQL BASICS ===============================

INTRO TO DATABASES

RDBMS: Relational DataBase Management Systems

Referring to the software application that manages databases for us.

The RDBMS is a software application that you run that your programs can connect to that they can store, modify, and retrieve data from a relational database. The RDBMS that you will use is called SQLite3.

Software developers will often use the term "database" to refer to the RDBMS. They will also say that "the data is in SQLite" or "the data is in Oracle" which is ambiguous because those are the names of the RDBMSes, not a database where the data is stored. That'd be like asking someone their address and them replying "Chicago"

What is SQLite?

SQLite is software. 
- It is an open-source, relational database management system. Most RDBMS rely on a client-server relationship where the RDBMS is the server and your server is the client that makes requests to the database server. 
- SQLite is different in that it is an embedded RDBMS that manages its data in a system's local file instead of a standalone service. It stores data in locally stored files instead of having to interact with a database server.

SQLite is one of if not the most popular SQL database management systems, used mainly for its simplicity and efficiency. You will install and connect SQLite to an application of your own in a later lesson.

There are many other implementations of SQL, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. The tools and techniques you learn with SQLite will work for those, with minor changes to account for slightly different implementations.

SUMMARY:

- Relational database management system is software that manages collections of structured data called databases.
- SQLite is one of many relational database management systems.
- Database is a collection of structured data that an RDBMS manages for you. 
- Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language that allows you to define the relational structure of the database and interact with the data in it.


DATABASE TABLE SCHEMAS =======================

COLUMN TYPES
- Choosing appropriate column types for your datasets will allow SQL to more efficiently store your data.

NUMERIC TYPES ----
ANSI SQL supports the following numeric types:

INTEGER - a number without a decimal.

DECIMAL - a number with a decimal,floating-point number.

BIGINT - will hold values between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

Another way you can use the DECIMAL type is to give it two arguments. The first number is the total number of digits that a number can have in that column. The second number is the number of digits after the decimal point that you want to track. The specification DECIMAL(4, 2) will hold the number 23.22, but not the numbers 123.22 (too many total digits) or 23.222 (which it will just ignore the extra decimal places and store 23.22). These exact numbers are important for things like storing values of money, where rounding errors could cause significant errors in calculations.


STRING TYPES ----

VARCHAR -  it can contain text of varying lengths up to a specified maximum.

VARCHAR(50) - hold up to 50 characters

TEXT - unlimited characters but slower


BOOLEAN TYPES ----
When you need to store a true or false


COLUMN TYPES IN SQLITE
Most SQL Databases use static, rigid data types for the columns. However, SQLite uses a more general, dynamic system. This means there are fewer types to worry about in your table definitions.

INTEGER - A number without decimals
REAL - A number with decimals (floating-point)
TEXT - A string
BLOB - Data stored exactly as it was input (good for images, really long text, and other big "blobs" of stuff)
NUMERIC - Special case for numbers which auto-converts between the other types, depending on the value

Fortunately, SQLite can understand the more rigid types, and it will "translate" to the corresponding SQLite column type.

SQLite will convert the BOOLEAN type to NUMERIC.

- false as 0 (zero)
- true as 1 (one)


COLUMN CONSTRAINTS

These are conditions that must be met by each entry in the column.
 Example: VARCHAR(50) type column is given the constraint of being a string type of no more than 50 characters. However, these aren't the only constraints you can place on columns.

NULL and NOT NULL ----
NULL is a possible value in a column that represents an empty column value. If you do not want to have any NULL values in a column, you could specify the column to be NOT NULL when defining it.

DEFAULT ----
If you want the column to have a default value when no value is given on insertion, use the DEFAULT constraint. You can define a default value for the column if no value exists for the column of an entity you're trying to insert into the table.

PRIMARY KEY ----
Is a column that contains unique identifiers for each entity in the table. For example, a Social Security Number is unique to a single person and could potentially be used as a primary key on a table that stores data of US citizens.

Often, primary keys are integers (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) because

1. There is not another column that must have a unique value
2. An integer primary key optimizes your SQL database for the fastest performance when retrieving data by the identifying column

AUTOINCREMENT ----
- Causes the default value to be the next integer in the series. So if the last entry has a value of 1234, the next entry that gets inserted will have a value of 1235 for the column with the AUTOINCREMENT constraint.

TIP: 
AUTOINCREMENT is commonly used in a primary key column, e.g. INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT.


STEPS TO DESIGNING A DATABASE

When designing your own database schemas, consider these factors in order. Start with what tables you will need, the columns within each table, and the types of each column. Remember to include a primary key column in each table.

INTRO TO RELATIONSHIPS IN DATABASES

Previously, you created relational database tables and accessed data from these tables through SQL queries. These tables (a.k.a. entities) contain rows (a.k.a. records) and columns (a.k.a. fields). You also learned how to uniquely identify table records by adding a PRIMARY KEY.

What is a FOREIGN KEY?
To relate one table to another, a FOREIGN KEY column is included which is associated with - or references the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

By convention, the name of a FOREIGN KEY is made by combining the singular form of the external, or foreign, table with the name of the primary key in that foreign table.

users table:
id - primary key
username
password

jobs table:
id - primary key
job_title
start_date
end_date
user_id - foreign key

ONE TO ONE OVERVIEW ----
The simplest relationship is one-to-one. This means one row in table A references one and only one row in table B. While it is not a common use of relationships, it can be quite useful for separating data based on its responsibilities. For example, a user's preferences like language or color mode could be stored separately from the login credentials.

users table:
id - primary key
username
password

preferences table:
user_id - foreign key & primary key
language
color_mode

PRIMARY KEY for the preferences table is also the FOREIGN KEY referencing the users table's PRIMARY KEY.

ONE TO MANY OVERVIEW ----
The one-to-many relationship is where each row in one table can be referenced one time by any number of rows in another table.

For example, "Each person has many jobs" is the one-to-many relationship shown in the people and jobs tables above.

MANY TO MANY OVERVIEW ----
The many-to-many relationship is where each row in one table can be referenced by many rows in another table, and vice versa.

For example, consider people reading books.

- Each person can read multiple books.
- Each book can be read by multiple people.


ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIPS

Scenario:
Each juice box is assigned to one student. Another way to say this is "each juice box is owned by one student", or "each student can have many juice boxes

Schema and schema diagram:
It can be very helpful to write down the representation of a database to specify the way it is structured. This structure is called the schema.

Schema for students table:
Column		Type		Constraints
id		integer		Primary Key
name		text

Schema for juices_boxes table:
Column		Type		Constraints
id		integer		Primary Key
juice		text
date		text
student_id	integer		Foreign Key
				References
				students(id)


The visual representation of the schema is called the schema diagram. Many diagramming tools like dbdiagram.io will label the connection line with a 1 and a * to represent the one-to-many relationship (as shown above).


SQL commands
The following code shows how to create these tables with the one-to-many relationship in SQLite3.

CREATE TABLE students (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE juice_boxes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  juice TEXT,
  date TEXT,
  student_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
);


MANY TO MANY RELATIONSHIPS
one-a-to-many-b + one-b-to-many-a = many-a-to-many-b

Scenario:
Consider students attending elementary school. Each student will study more than one subject. Also, each subject will be studied by more than one student.

One student => Many subjects
One subject => Many students


When combined, this means many students are related to many subjects, a.k.a. a many-to-many relationship between students and subjects.

The way to connect two tables in a many-to-many relationship is using a third table called a join table. This special kind of table stores a foreign key for the primary key from each of the tables that need to be connected.

In this scenario, a join table connecting the students and subjects to create a many-to-many relationship needs to hold the primary keys of the students and subjects tables as foreign keys. It is not necessary for the join table to have its own primary key in this case because it's only purpose is to act as a connecting table.

SAMPLE DATA

students table:
id		name
1		Alim
2		Andrei
3		Belma

subjects table:
101		Reading
102		Writing
103		Arithmetic
104		Art
105		Music

student_subject table:
1		101
1		102
1		103
1		104
2		101
2		102
2		103
2		105
3		101
3		102
3		103
3		104

Many times the data provided by the business team will look just like this:

STUDENT ID	STUDENT NAME	SUBJECT ID	SUBJECT NAME
1		Alim		101		Reading
1		Alim		102		Writing
1		Alim		103		Arithmetic
1		Alim		104		Art
2		Andrei		101		Reading
2		Andrei		102		Writing
2		Andrei		103		Arithmetic
2		Andrei		105		Music
3		Belma		101		Reading
3		Belma		102		Writing
3		Belma		103		Arithmetic
3		Belma		104		Art

Schema and schema diagram
Writing out the schema before building a database is a useful exercise.

Schema for the abbreviated students and subjects tables in this example:

column		type		constraints
id		integer		primary key
name		text	


Schema for student-subject join table:
column		type		constraints
student_id	integer		Foreign key
				References
				students(id)
subject_id	integer		Foreign key
				References
				subjects(id)

Represented visually in a schema diagram a many-to-many relationship can be easy to spot because the join table sits between two connector lines.

When the two connector lines are labelled with 1 and * on opposite ends, this leads to * to * - meaning "many" to "many" - between the two entity tables.


SQL commands
The following code shows how to create these tables with the many-to-many relationship in SQLite3.

CREATE TABLE students (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE subjects (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE student_subject (
  student_id INTEGER,
  subject_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
  FOREIGN KEY (subject_id) REFERENCES subjects(id)
);

CREATE TABLE console_game (
  console_id INTEGER,
  game_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (console_id) REFERENCES consoles(id)
  FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games(id)
)

Many-to-Many Database Design

A join table table is a table that sits between the other tables in a many-to-many relationship. It stores a record of each of the foreign keys of the other tables. Which is used to reference the data from the other tables. Overall, a join table provides a more developed data structure.

The above schema depicts a many-to-many relationship between the products table and the orders table. A single order can have multiple products, and a single product can belong to multiple orders. We created a third join table called order_details, which contains both the order_id and product_id fields as foreign keys. The foreign keys in the order_details table (product_id and order_id) reference the primary keys in the products table (id) and the orders table (id). This allows your database to make multiple connections between seperate data tables.

This table relationship would produce the following example data(note that not all columns are shown below):

Products:
ID		NAME
1597		Glass Coffee Mug
1598		Metallic Coffee Mug
1599		Smart Coffee Mug

Users:
ID		NAME
1		Alice
2		Bob

Orders:
ID		PURCHASER_ID
10		1
11		1
12		2

Order Details:
ID		ORDER_ID		PRODUCT_ID
1		10			1599
2		11			1597
3		11			1598
4		12			1597
5		12			1598
6		12			1599

Using the foreign keys, you should be able to reason out that "Alice" has two orders. One order containing a "Smart Coffee Mug" and another order containing both a "Glass Coffee Mug" and "Metallic Coffee Mug". Bob had one order containing three items, one of each mug

- Don't forget the fourth stage in RDD, to apply normalization rules to your tables to optimize the database structure reducing redundancy and confusion.


RELATIONAL DATABASE DESIGN STAGES
tables - entities
rows - records
columns - fields

Stages of Relational Database Design

1. Define the purpose/entities of the relational DB.
2. Identify primary keys.
3. Establish table relationships.
4. Apply normalization rules.


Define database purpose and entities --
- Why is the database being created? What problem is it solving? What is the data used for?
- If you were creating a database for order processing on an e-commerce application, you would need a database with at least three tables: a products table, an orders tables, and a users (i.e. customers) table. You can reason that a product will probably have an ID, name, and price, and an order will contain one or more product IDs. Also, each user can place multiple orders.

Identify primary keys --
- For our above example of online orders, we would probably create IDs to serve as the primary key for each table: a product ID, an order ID, and a user ID.

Establish table relationships -- 
- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-many


One-to-many relationship
In a one-to-many relationship, each record in Table A is associated with multiple records in Table B. Each record in Table B is associated with only one record in Table A. This is achieved by utilizing the primary key and foreign key. The foreign key in Table B references the primary key of Table A.	

One user can create multiple orders.

The primary key of the users table (id) is a foreign key in the orders table (purchaser_id). This allows the foreign key (purchaser_id) in the orders table to reference the users table (id) to identify which user made each order.


Apply normalization rules --
- Normalization is the process of optimizing the database structure so that redundancy and confusion are eliminated.

The rules of normalization are called “normal forms” and are as follows:

1. First normal form
2. Second normal form
3. Third normal form
4. Boyce-Codd normal form
5. Fifth normal form

The first three forms are widely used in practice, while the fourth and fifth are less often used.

First normal form rules: ------------------
- Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.
- Create a separate table for each set of related data.
- Identify each set of related data with a primary key.


Second normal form rules:-----------------
- Create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records.
- Relate these tables with a foreign key.


Third normal form rules:------------------
- Eliminate fields that do not depend on the table’s key.

Visualizing Relational Database Schemas

people table:
SSN		FIRST_NAME	LAST_NAME
123-45-6789	John		Doe
987-65-4329	Jane		Doe
987-65-4320	John		Smith

cats table:
OWNER_SSN	ID		NAME
123-45-6789	1		Callie
123-45-6789	2		Charley
987-65-4320	3		Jaxson

fur table:
ID		NAME
1		brown
2		white
3		grey

cats_fur table:
CAT_ID		FUR_ID
1		1
1		2
2		2
2		3
3		1

one-to-many type relationship
This refers to scenarios where one entity is associated with multiple entities in another table. Using the people/cats table examples above, you can see that John is the owner of both Callie and Charley, but Callie has only one owner, John.

many-to-many relationships
Consider the color of fur for the cats - each cat can have multiple colors, and each color can appear on multiple cats. This is a scenario where one entity is associated with multiple entities in another table in BOTH DIRECTIONS. The typical solution to is to place a join table "between" the entity tables.


Using the cats/cats_fur/fur tables, you can see Callie is brown and white, Charley is white and grey, and Jaxson is just plain brown.

NORMALIZATION

- is the process of removing potential anomalies from the database design.

Insertion anomalies - not enough field
Update anomalies - update causes duplication
Deletion anomalies - removing a data forever


DATABASE CONNECTIONS

A database is a place where data is stored, but data should not always be publicly accessible. Only with the proper authorization should someone be able to enter a database to retrieve or manipulate the data within.

Restricting Access with Username/Password Credentials
- Many RDBMS's use a username and password combination as a means to restrict access to a database. The RDBMS can support multiple different user roles (e.g. Read Access Only, Read and Write Access, etc.), so having credentials will verify what actions a user can perform on a database.

Access via URL Connection
A database is a server; you make requests to it and receive responses from it. Much like connecting to a server, you can also make requests to a database via a URL. The URL connection string could look something like this:

jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test?user=fred&password=secret&ssl=true

Note that in the above example, the username and password are embedded into the connection string. It is also possible to exclude the username and password and authorize a connection based on the origin of the request, namely an IP address.

DB as a Service
Some applications opt to use cloud databases to host their data using third-party vendors instead of creating their own database server. This is because security, role management, reliability, uptime, etc. make managing a database complex; vendors provide convenient tools, making your job of maintaining a database easier. You can connect to these kinds of databases using a URL connection string.

Definitely consider using a database as a service for any projects you may have.

SQLite3: The Exception
SQLite3 is unique as an RDBMS in that it stores its data in a file instead of behind a database server. This means that anyone that has access to the file has access to the contents of the database, which includes reading and writing. For this reason, SQLite3 should only be used in a testing environment and NOT a production environment.

The file extension of the database file is conventionally .db. For example, an application that stores cute cats' information can have a SQLite3 database file called cats.db.

Transient in-memory database
Instead of storing the contents of the database in a file, SQLite3 will keep track of the database contents in memory if no file to use is specified. The database can be interacted with in the same way as if it was being written to a file, but its contents will be permanently lost as soon as the instance is exited out of in the terminal.

SIMPLE SQL LITE COMMANDS
cd folder
> sqlite3
> .open example.db
> .read example.sql
> .tables
> .schema
> SELECT * FROM samples;
> .headers on - show the names of each of the columns in the rows of the query result.
> SELECT * FROM samples;
> ctrl+z

- Insert it into a database
.read create-table.sql

- To verify that the table has been properly created and populated
SELECT * FROM pies;

- See the pies schema
.schema

If you wanted to reset your database using this file, you may end up duplicating the data if you simply ran .read create-table.sql again. For this reason, it would be best to add this line at the beginning of create-table.sql:
DROP TABLE pies;

If the pies table exists, it will be dropped first before recreating it. This way, your table doesn't contain duplicate data. If the table doesn't already exist, SQLite3 will throw an error, but will still run the remaining SQL, so your table will be created regardless.


Why would a .sql file be beneficial to use?
Using a .sql file allows for database setup and test or seed data to be created very easily. Saving the SQL to a file has similar benefits as saving JavaScript to a .js file versus typing out and running the code directly in Node.


SQL and Express ========================================

Begin with Express boilerplate
npm install express dotenv nodemon
Require package and instantiate database
npm install sqlite3

// Instantiate SQLite and database
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3');
const db = new sqlite3.Database(
    process.env.data_source,
    sqlite3.OPEN_READWRITE
);
Tip: Using a constant for the database name, if used, should only be a temporary part of the code.

sqlite3.OPEN_READWRITE 
- means that the Express server can read and write to the database (that is, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE). However, it will NOT be able to CREATE or DROP tables.

Query for all records ----
app.get('/trees', (req, res, next) => {
    const sql = 'SELECT id, name FROM trees';
    const params = [];

    db.all(sql, params, (err, rows) => {
        if (err) {
            next(err);
        } else {
            res.json(rows);
        }
    });
});

- first argument in any of the database callback functions is err which holds the error
- second parameter is the result of the function call.

db.all(), the result is an array of rows.


Query to get 1 row ----
app.get('/trees/:id', (req, res, next) => {
   const sql = 'SELECT * FROM trees WHERE id = ?';
   const params = [req.params.id];

    db.get(sql, params, (err, row) => {
        if (err) {
          next(err);
        } else {
          res.json(row);
        }
    });
});

question mark (?) in the SQL statement is where a dynamic value needs to go.


Using run on non-SELECT SQL statements ----

Running other SQL statements, like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE follow a similar pattern:

- Constant for the SQL statement, with ? where dynamic values need to go
- Constant array for the params to substitute for each ? in the same order as the ?'s in the SQL constant
- Calling the appropriate database function with the SQL statement, params, and result handler function

app.post('/trees', (req, res, next) => {
    // SQL INSERT
    const sql = `
        INSERT INTO trees (tree, location, height_ft, ground_circumference_ft)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);
    `;
    const params = [
        req.body.name,
        req.body.location,
        req.body.height,
        req.body.size
    ];

    // SQL QUERY NEW ROW
    const sqlLast = 'SELECT * FROM trees ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1';

    // Call database to INSERT and, if successful, return new row
    db.run(sql, params, (err) => {
        if (err) {
            next(err);
        } else {
            db.get(sqlLast, [], (err, row) => {
                res.json(row);
            });
        }
    });
});

Best Practices
- It is useful to return the row that was added, removed or changed (instead of the generic success message shown above).


CREATE/DROP Tables ========================

Naming a table
- snake_case
- plural form of the data that it holds

Good table names
- student_grades
- office_locations
- people

Bad (incorrect) table names
- Student Grades
- office-locations
- person


Writing the SQL
- it uses parentheses, not curly braces
-  the last column specification cannot have a comma after it

EXAMPLE:
COLUMN		JS DATA TYPE	MAX LENGTH		ANSI SQL DATA TYPE
id		integer					INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
name		string		50			VARCHAR(50)
age_yrs		number		3 digits, 1 decimal	NUMERIC(3,1)
breed		string		100			VARCHAR(100)
weight_lbs	number					INTEGER
microchipped	Boolean					BOOLEAN

CREATE TABLE puppies (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  age_yrs NUMERIC(3,1),
  breed VARCHAR(100),
  weight_lbs INTEGER,
  microchipped BOOLEAN
);

Dropping a table
DROP TABLE puppies;

- Note that dropping tables is a dangerous operation as it deletes all the data in the table with it.

Allow a DROP TABLE command to be called without error at a time when a table does not exist
> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS puppies;


INSERT Data

Table schema
CREATE TABLE friends (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);


Inserting data into the example table
INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
  ('Amy', 'Pond');

- Note the use of single quotation marks for string values. Also note that, with the AUTOINCREMENT constraint on id you don't need to specify the value when inserting

Multiple values insert
INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
  ('Rose', 'Tyler'),
  ('Martha', 'Jones'),
  ('Donna', 'Noble'),
  ('River', 'Song');

Use SELECT * FROM friends; to verify that there are rows in the friends table

- You may get an error when inserting duplicate data into a column with a UNIQUE constraint.
INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (5, 'Jenny', 'Who');

Because id is a primary key and that id is already taken, you should get a message in SQLite that it already exists:

Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: friends.id


SELECT Data ==============================
What is a query?
- A query is simply a question you're asking a database, and you're aiming to get a response back. The response comes back to you as a list of table rows.

The syntax for the SELECT query is SELECT [columns] FROM [table];

EXAMPLE
create the puppies table, and insert the rows using the following:

CREATE TABLE puppies (
  id INTEGER,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age_yrs DECIMAL(2,1),
  breed VARCHAR(100),
  weight_lbs INT,
  microchipped BOOLEAN
);

INSERT INTO puppies 
VALUES 
  (1, 'Cooper', 1, 'Miniature Schnauzer', 18, 1),
  (2, 'Indie', 0.5, 'Yorkshire Terrier', 13, 1),
  (3, 'Kota', 0.7, 'Australian Shepherd', 26, 0),
  (4, 'Zoe', 0.8, 'Korean Jindo', 32, 1),
  (5, 'Charley', 1.5, 'Basset Hound', 25, 0),
  (6, 'Ladybird', 0.6, 'Labradoodle', 20, 1),
  (7, 'Callie', 0.9, 'Corgi', 16, 0),
  (8, 'Jaxson', 0.4, 'Beagle', 19, 1),
  (9, 'Leinni', 1, 'Miniature Schnauzer', 25, 1),
  (10, 'Max', 1.6, 'German Shepherd', 65, 0);

Note that in SQLite, the BOOLEAN datatype is represented as 1s and 0s for TRUE and FALSE respectively.

SELECT SPECIFIC COLUMNS ----
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs FROM puppies;

SELECT ALL COLUMNS ----
SELECT * FROM puppies;

SELECT WITH THE WHERE CLAUSE;
Just using the SELECT query by itself will return every row in the table, but if you want to only select rows that satisfy a certain condition, the WHERE clause can filter your results. Clauses in SQL are parts of a query that can filter or manipulate how you want your rows returned to you.

WHERE clause for a single value
SELECT * FROM puppies WHERE id = 5;

Note that string values MUST use single quotation marks.


PRACTICE SELECT DATA ===============

sqlite3 practice.db

SELECT * FROM puppies;
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs FROM puppies;
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE id = 5;
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE microchipped = true;
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs > 25;
SELECT name, age_yrs, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs > 25 AND microchipped = true;

Tip: 
- On numeric columns (INTEGER and REAL), SQL uses comparison operators similar to JavaScript (e.g. >, >=, <, <=).
- Like JavaScript, SQL has a way to combine conditionals using logical statements such as AND, OR and NOT.


DELETE Data ----

DELETE FROM [table] WHERE [condition];

If you omit the WHERE, then all rows from your table will be deleted. This is different from dropping the table because the table still exists, but there just aren't any rows in it. Similar to dropping tables, DELETE statements should also be used judiciously in production to avoid deleting data by accident.
DELETE FROM puppies WHERE microchipped = 0;
SELECT * FROM puppies;


UPDATE Data ----

CREATE TABLE friends (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
('Amy', 'Pond'),
('Rose', 'Tyler'),
('Martha', 'Jones'),
('Donna', 'Noble'),
('River', 'Song');

Updating a row in a database table
In order to update data in a database, you'll need to specify:

- The table to UPDATE
- Which column to SET with the new value to set it too
- WHERE to find the row to update.

UPDATE friends
SET last_name = 'Blue'
WHERE first_name = 'Amy' AND last_name = 'Pond';

SELECT * FROM friends;

Silent failures
If no rows match the WHERE statement, the UPDATE will fail silently. This means there is no error message, and the table is unchanged.

Tip: 
Query the table using SELECT to make sure you have the proper WHERE clause before using it in an UPDATE statement.

UPDATE errors
For example, if you try to modify a column with a UNIQUE constraint.
# BAD - DO NOT DO THIS!
UPDATE friends
SET id = 2
WHERE id = 1;

Error: UNIQUE constraint failed: friends.id
